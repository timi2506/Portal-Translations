Introduction

Welcome to my guide on how to sideload on Apple Devices!

Some of the advantages with using this method:

Free!

No PC!

Easy to use!

No App Limits!

On Device Signing!

No Privacy Concerns!

Takes 5 Minutes to Setup!

Compatible with Scarlet/Feather/ESign/GBox

If you have any issues, requests or ideas please make an issue on GitHub or Discord.

How does this method work?

By using enterprise certificates, We can sign apps using their credentials which means Apple lets us install the apps without any hassle, however after a while Apple revokes the certificate which can be easily bypassed by using this method.

We have made our own app called “Portal” and it contains all links to ESign, Feather, GBox and Scarlet inside the app itself!

Unsupported Methods

We don’t support other guides that use services such as NextDNS as those have limits, and apps will revoke if you pass that limit.

The madNS Config Profile itself uses NextDNS and is transparent as we could make it. It is run for by donators and will keep running for as long as possible.

Before we start

This might not work for you if you’ve been using other enterprise sideloaders as the certificates might be revoked on your device!

If you know that you are revoked you will need to follow the the Revoked guide here

This will work as long as you read and do all of the steps properly!

Compatibility

This should work for all iOS and iPadOS devices on latest iOS versions, won’t work for iOS 15 and below. The guide is compatible with other sideloading services as long as they rely on enterprise certificates to install.

Privacy

You can view the privacy report here

If you still have privacy concerns about the madNS Config Profile, make an issue on github with your email and i’ll send you a viewing invite so you can see the settings for yourself.

Make sure to mention exactly what the madNS’s profile name is so I can give it to you!

If you STILL have privacy concerns, use the WSF Config Profile, it uses a native iOS Configuration Profile method to redirect Apple Certificate Servers to https://localhost.direct, making sure it will never reach Apple and revoke your apps!

FAQ

Q - Can I use a VPN?

A - You can if you’re utilising the madNS Config Profile, make sure to set it up first! VPN Guide is in the Portal app!

Q - Will a restart bypass this and revoke my apps?

A - Some users have found that on older devices, your apps might revoke, disable Wi-Fi and enable Airplane Mode when wanting to restart or shutdown.

Q - Will services such as AltStore, Sideloadly and Sidestore affect this guide at all?

A - No, Those listed services use developer signing instead of Enterprise signing so they are fine to use alongside! You will however need to setup the Sideloadly’s WireGuard, VPN Guide is in the Portal app!

Starting the main guide, Read everything carefully!
